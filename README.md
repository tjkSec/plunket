### Plunket
Plunket is a online terminal I created with react, the future goal for this repo is to have many different uses and abilities. I thought it would be cool if other peope uploads their own functions making plunket a huge resource for day to day activities like generating passwords or telling jokes.

Check it out here, it's based on the ubuntu terminal https://tjksec.github.io/plunket/build/
